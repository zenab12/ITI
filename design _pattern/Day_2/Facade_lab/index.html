    <title>Facade design pattern solution</title>
</head>

<body>

    <h1>Facade design pattern</h1>
    <p>
        The facade design pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a
        framework, or any other complex set of classes.
    </p>
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
        Imagine that you are working on a project that uses a complex set of classes. You are working on a part of the
        project that uses a lot of these classes. You are not interested in the details of how these classes work. You
        just want to use them to get the job done. You don't want to have to learn how to use all of these classes. You
        don't want to have to learn ho
    </p>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
        The facade design pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem of classes, library or
        framework. A facade can:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make a software library easier to use, understand and test, since the facade has convenient methods for
            common tasks;</li>
        <li>Make the library more readable, for the same reason;</li>
        <li>Reduce dependencies of outside code on the inner workings of a library, since most code uses the facade,
            thus allowing more flexibility in developing the system;</li>
        <li>Wrap a poorly designed collection of APIs with a single well-designed API.</li>
    </ul>
